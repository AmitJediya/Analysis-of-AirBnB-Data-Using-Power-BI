Analysis of District Location Scores- 
Visual representation of average location scores using stacked column chart and measure for creating average location scores which will help us to understand the highest and lowest rated district by customers.

Impact of host response time on customer rating-
Visual representation of host response time to the customer query and overall rating received by the customer using donut chart.
It helps us understand that customers have given highest rating to the host who have responded to the query of a customer within a few hours or within few hours though the variation in the response time is very sparse. It helps us to understand that there is impact on host response time on customer rating quicker the host response to customer higher the ratings are received by customer.
City wise pricing analysis-
Visual representation of listing price by city around the world using map chart.
 It helps us understand the average price of listing around the world, as observed Cape town have the costliest listings while Rome has the affordable and cheap listing price.
Analysis of listing checking experience and host communication-
For this analysis we have created a calculated column of checking experience and host communication scores as a composite score.
Then we have used stack bar chart for visual representation of composite score by districts it will help us to identify the district with highest and lowest composite score.

Analysis of host tenure-
Visual representation of host tenure and host id is done using table chart and slicer for city.
It will help us identify the oldest host we have and its tenure also we can check the oldest host by city using the slicer for advance analysis.

Property Type Price Analysis-
Visual representation of pricing of property type by city is done using tree map chart.
Which will help us identify the price of property where entire place can be booked by city and as observed villa type property have the highest price compare to other property and cape town have the costliest properties.

Analysis of average ratings & monthly trend in visitors-
Here we have used multiple charts like line and clustered, matrix, area chart and card to create city insight report.
Using this report we can identify city wise overall scores, accuracy scores and cleanliness scores given by customers it also gives insight of total number of listings, prices by cities and the monthly trend in visitors and we have observed that monthly trend in visitors was higher after September in 2019 which was followed until February 2020 after that there was an huge downslide in visitors across all cities & this is majorly because of COVID-19 which occurred in start of 2020 after that all over the world there was an lockdown and due to which there was an huge downslide.
